# BitLend Protocol
*Bitcoin-Native Cross-Chain Lending via Stacks & sBTC*

## üöÄ Vision

BitLend transforms Bitcoin into productive cross-chain collateral without compromising self-custody. Deposit your Bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, mint synthetic assets across any supported chain. No wrapped tokens, no bridge risks - just pure Bitcoin-backed liquidity everywhere.

## üéØ What Problem We're Solving

Bitcoin holders want DeFi access but face impossible choices:
- **Sell Bitcoin** ‚Üí Lose upside exposure
- **Use wrapped BTC** ‚Üí Trust centralized bridges
- **Bridge to L2s** ‚Üí Pay fees + counterparty risk

BitLend eliminates these tradeoffs. Your Bitcoin stays on Bitcoin. Your liquidity works everywhere.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Deposit Bitcoin** ‚Üí Lock BTC in sBTC contract on Bitcoin L1
2. **Mint sBTC** ‚Üí Trust-minimized Bitcoin representation on Stacks
3. **Cross-Chain Magic** ‚Üí Use sBTC as collateral to mint synthetic assets on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.
4. **Keep Earning** ‚Üí Your Bitcoin position remains intact while accessing DeFi yields

Built on Stacks' revolutionary sBTC bridge + Chainlink CCIP for seamless cross-chain execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Bitcoin Layer**: Native BTC deposits via sBTC protocol
- **Stacks Layer**: Clarity smart contracts for collateral management
- **Cross-Chain**: Chainlink CCIP for multi-chain synthetic asset minting
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with Stacks.js integration
- **Oracles**: Chainlink Price Feeds + Stacks native oracles

## ‚ö° Getting Started

> **Note**: This is a solo developer project built with passion, coffee, and countless Stack Overflow visits. Expecting some rough edges while we build toward production!

- Implements secure message replay protection

**`price-oracle-aggregator.clar`**
- Aggregates price feeds from multiple sources
- Implements fallback mechanisms for oracle failures
- Provides real-time BTC/USD and collateral ratios

**`governance.clar`**
- Protocol parameter management (LTV ratios, interest rates)
- Timelock mechanisms for critical updates
- Community voting for protocol upgrades

**`liquidation-engine.clar`**
- Automated liquidation detection and execution
- Keeper incentive mechanisms
- Partial liquidation support for better capital efficiency

### EVM Contracts (`/contracts/evm/`)

**`BitLendEthereum.sol`**
- Receives cross-chain messages from Stacks via Chainlink CCIP
- Mints synthetic USDC/USDT backed by Bitcoin collateral
- Implements ERC-20 synthetic asset standards

**`SyntheticAssetFactory.sol`**
- Factory pattern for creating new synthetic assets
- Manages synthetic asset metadata and configurations
- Handles synthetic asset burning and redemption

**`CCIPMessageReceiver.sol`**
- Chainlink CCIP integration for cross-chain message handling
- Message validation and authentication
- Gas optimization for cross-chain operations

**`EmergencyControls.sol`**
- Circuit breakers and emergency pause functionality
- Multi-sig controls for critical operations
- Upgrade mechanisms with timelock delays

### Solana Programs (`/contracts/solana/`)

**`bitlend_solana/src/lib.rs`**
- Main Anchor program for Solana synthetic asset minting
- Cross-chain message verification and processing
- SPL token integration for synthetic assets

**`instructions/mint_synthetic.rs`**
- Handles synthetic asset minting on Solana
- Validates cross-chain collateral commitments
- Implements proper PDA (Program Derived Address) patterns

**`instructions/cross_chain_verify.rs`**
- Verifies Chainlink CCIP messages from Stacks
- Signature validation and replay protection
- State synchronization with Bitcoin collateral

### Frontend Integration (`/frontend/`)

**Key Components:**
- **Stacks Wallet Integration**: Connect.js for Bitcoin/Stacks wallets
- **Multi-Chain UI**: Unified interface for cross-chain operations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Position health, collateral ratios, liquidation alerts
- **Transaction Batching**: Optimize cross-chain operation costs

## üîí Security Features

- **Time-locked governance** for protocol changes
- **Multi-signature controls** for emergency functions
- **Comprehensive test coverage** (targeting 95%+)
- **Formal verification** for critical contract functions
- **Bug bounty program** (coming with mainnet)

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Core Bitcoin collateral + Ethereum synthetic assets
**Phase 2**: Expand to Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum
**Phase 3**: Flash loans, yield optimization, governance token
**Phase 4**: Mobile app, institutional features

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a solo project that needs community help! Areas where contributions are most valuable:

- **Smart contract optimization** and gas improvements
- **Frontend UX/UI** enhancements and mobile responsiveness  
- **Security reviews** and formal verification assistance
- **Documentation** improvements and tutorial creation
- **Integration ideas** for new chains and protocols

## üìû Support & Community
