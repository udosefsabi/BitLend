# BitLend Protocol
*Bitcoin-Native Cross-Chain Lending via Stacks & sBTC*

## üöÄ Vision

BitLend transforms Bitcoin into productive cross-chain collateral without compromising self-custody. Deposit your Bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, mint synthetic assets across any supported chain. No wrapped tokens, no bridge risks - just pure Bitcoin-backed liquidity everywhere.

## üéØ What Problem We're Solving

Bitcoin holders want DeFi access but face impossible choices:
- **Sell Bitcoin** ‚Üí Lose upside exposure
- **Use wrapped BTC** ‚Üí Trust centralized bridges
- **Bridge to L2s** ‚Üí Pay fees + counterparty risk

BitLend eliminates these tradeoffs. Your Bitcoin stays on Bitcoin. Your liquidity works everywhere.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Deposit Bitcoin** ‚Üí Lock BTC in sBTC contract on Bitcoin L1
2. **Mint sBTC** ‚Üí Trust-minimized Bitcoin representation on Stacks
3. **Cross-Chain Magic** ‚Üí Use sBTC as collateral to mint synthetic assets on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.
4. **Keep Earning** ‚Üí Your Bitcoin position remains intact while accessing DeFi yields

Built on Stacks' revolutionary sBTC bridge + Chainlink CCIP for seamless cross-chain execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Bitcoin Layer**: Native BTC deposits via sBTC protocol
- **Stacks Layer**: Clarity smart contracts for collateral management
- **Cross-Chain**: Chainlink CCIP for multi-chain synthetic asset minting
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with Stacks.js integration
- **Oracles**: Chainlink Price Feeds + Stacks native oracles

## ‚ö° Getting Started

> **Note**: This is a solo developer project built with passion, coffee, and countless Stack Overflow visits. Expecting some rough edges while we build toward production!

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Bitcoin testnet access
# Stacks testnet (Nakamoto)
# Node.js 18+
# Clarinet CLI for Stacks development
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitlend-protocol
cd bitlend-protocol
npm install

# Install Stacks dependencies
cd contracts/stacks
clarinet install

# Install EVM dependencies  
cd ../evm
npm install

# Install Solana dependencies
cd ../solana
npm install
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your RPC URLs, API keys, and wallet addresses
```

### Development
```bash
# Start local development
npm run dev

# Test Stacks contracts
cd contracts/stacks && clarinet test

# Test EVM contracts
cd contracts/evm && npm run test

# Deploy to testnets
npm run deploy:testnet
```
### Frontend Integration (`/frontend/`)

**Key Components:**
- **Stacks Wallet Integration**: Connect.js for Bitcoin/Stacks wallets
- **Multi-Chain UI**: Unified interface for cross-chain operations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Position health, collateral ratios, liquidation alerts
- **Transaction Batching**: Optimize cross-chain operation costs

## üîí Security Features

- **Time-locked governance** for protocol changes
- **Multi-signature controls** for emergency functions
- **Comprehensive test coverage** (targeting 95%+)
- **Formal verification** for critical contract functions
- **Bug bounty program** (coming with mainnet)

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Core Bitcoin collateral + Ethereum synthetic assets
**Phase 2**: Expand to Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum
**Phase 3**: Flash loans, yield optimization, governance token
**Phase 4**: Mobile app, institutional features

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a solo project that needs community help! Areas where contributions are most valuable:

- **Smart contract optimization** and gas improvements
- **Frontend UX/UI** enhancements and mobile responsiveness  
- **Security reviews** and formal verification assistance
- **Documentation** improvements and tutorial creation
- **Integration ideas** for new chains and protocols

## üìû Support & Community

- **Issues**: GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: GitHub Discussions for general questions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

BitLend is experimental software under active development. Use testnet funds only. Mainnet deployment will occur after comprehensive security audits and community testing.
